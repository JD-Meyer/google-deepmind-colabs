**Anticipation**:
- paying close attention to the context in which a technology will be integrated, 
- being sensitive to the people, ways of life, organizations, and environments it will touch
- thinking carefully about how communities, cultural practices, and organisational workflows might be altered when an LLM is introduced
- a way of reducing risks and maximizing potential benefits
