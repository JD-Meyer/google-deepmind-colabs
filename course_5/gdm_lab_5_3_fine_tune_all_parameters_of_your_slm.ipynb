The target tokens are a shifted version of the input tokens such that every element in the target is shifted by one position to the left. During training, the model then learns to predict the target token at every position $i$ from all input tokens up to position $i$. The parameters are updated according to the loss of each target token, so that during the next iteration of training, the model makes better predictions for each token in the training data.\n",

First, you also have to prepare the data as a sequence of input and target tokens. For question-answer tasks, such as the flashcard generation task, you therefore have to turn the question-answer pair into a single sequence of tokens. You can do this by concatenating the question and the answer:\n",

This would likely work and your model would eventually become proficient in generating the flashcard responses in the correct format for a given question. Note, if you are training a model using these inputs and outputs, you are not only teaching it to provide effective answers but also how to ask questions. This is because the loss is not computed only for tokens in the response but also for the tokens in the prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "To avoid teaching the model unnecessary skills (recall that the task here is designed such that users always provide a question), you can limit the computation of the loss function to the tokens in the response. This means that the model still learns to base the response on the prompt, since it can attend to the tokens in the prompt when predicting tokens in the answer. In this case the weights are only updated such that the model performs better at the task of interest i.e., generating responses for the flashcard generator.\n",
        "\n",
        "One technique you can use to ignore the tokens in the question from the loss computation is to replace them with the special `<PAD>` token in the target sequence. This is because the loss function is generally implemented such that it ignores the predictions at all positions where the target token is `<PAD>`. Applying this technique would then lead to the following pair of inputs and targets:\n",
