Note that you are using a model here that is different from your SLM and also you are training the model using LoRA instead of performing full-parameter fine-tuning. Therefore, the optimal hyperparameters may be different for fine-tuning the Gemma model than the ones you used to fine-tune your SLM.\n",

If you use a larger fine-tuning set and/or a higher learning rate, you generally need to fine-tune for fewer epochs. Conversely, if you have very few fine-tuning examples or use a very low learning rate, you will need to fine-tune for more epochs.\n",
