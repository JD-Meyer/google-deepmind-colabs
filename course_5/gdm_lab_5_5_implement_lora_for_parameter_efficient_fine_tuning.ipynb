        "In the last lab, you observed that it is difficult or impossible to perform full-parameter fine-tuning of a large language model without access to special resources. The solution to this problem is to use fewer parameters following a strategy of **parameter-efficient fine-tuning**.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you have encountered in the previous article, **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** is a widely used strategy to fine-tune a transformer without training all of its parameters [1]. LoRA is based on the idea that many matrices can be approximated by multiplying two considerably smaller matrices. The weight updates during fine-tuning then affect only these smaller matrices, which makes LoRA a lot more efficient than full-parameter fine-tuning. Furthermore, in practice, LoRA achieves about the same performance as full-parameter fine-tuning, so despite the lower memory requirement, there is little to no degradation in performance.\n",

        "In the lab \"Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning\", you fine-tuned a small transformer by continuing to update all of its parameters. You observed that this approach did not work for large models. When you tried to train all the parameters of Gemma-1B in Colab, it ran out of memory.  Even though you could circumvent this problem by buying or renting machines with more powerful GPUs, this is costly. Further, this issue gets worse when you consider bigger models. For example, Gemma-1B with its 1.3 billion parameters is relatively small for a large language model and there exist implementations of Gemma with considerably more parameters, such as Gemma-27B [2]. Full-parameter fine-tuning such a model on a single GPU would be impossible even with the most powerful GPUs available today.\n",
