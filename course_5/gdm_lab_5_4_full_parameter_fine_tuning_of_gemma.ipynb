A model of this size typically requires around 4GB of memory, so it fits on a T4 GPU with 15GB of memory. However, a 27B model, that is a model with around 27 billion parameters would require roughly 100 GB of memory (27 $\\times$ ~3.7 GB), which exceeds the capacity of a single T4 GPU multiple times.\n",
