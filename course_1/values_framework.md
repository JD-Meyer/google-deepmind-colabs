6. Keep notes


1. Personal value: Integrity
2. Based on Ubuntu personhood
3. Once given, I must keep my word. This means I must not make a commitment until I understand the implications thoroughly, 
and I must follow through until finished, or it becomes clear that following through causes harm that could be diverted by another course of action.
4. Small choices can have long-ranging consequences. 
    Plan before executing.


1. Personal value: Proceduralism
2. Based on Western philosophy
3. Use standardized processes to ensure repeatability, reportability, and scalability.
4. This should be the central tenet of software development. If you can repeat it, you can fix it.
5. If you plan for long-term sustainability, you'll be less likely to mess it up the first time.


1. Personal value: Live Simply
2. Based on Ubuntu Communal Character 
3. Prioritize non-technical solutions over technical solutions whenever possible.
4. Just because it exists, that doesn't mean I need it. Just because I can, that doesn't mean I should.
5. LLMs are vastly capable, but they shouldn't do work I can do for myself.
