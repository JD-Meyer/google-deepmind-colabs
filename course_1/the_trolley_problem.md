# The Trolley Problem
An ethical dilemma that forces the user to choose:
- Do nothing -> Kill 5 people
- Do something -> Kill 1 person

Do you **accept responsibility** for the death of a single person
OR **Deny** responsibility for the deaths of 5 people?

*Hypothetically*, most people would accept responsibility for the death of 1 person.
This is an application of doing the least harm.

*In reality*, most people would probably do nothing rather than accept responsibility.
This is a function of personal risk-avoidance.

*Afterward*, they would rationalize their decision to do nothing.
