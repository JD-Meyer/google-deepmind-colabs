# Introduction to Language Models
**Deep Learning**
- class of ML
- foundation of modern LLMs

**Language Modeling**
- Languages follow rules, like syntax and grammar
- If you can teach a machine the rules for spoken language, it can learn the rules for similar pattern-modeling systems
  - Climate modeling
  - Protein folding
  - Writing music
  - Coding

* A language model with a low temperature is deterministic.
