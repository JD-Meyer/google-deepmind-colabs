# Case study: RobotsMali - Using AI to tackle illiteracy in Mali

1. Choose three sectors that LLMs could support from the following list
Law
Languages
Education

## Law
Laws are applied unequally, resulting in penalizing the poor and destitute, while allowing the wealthy and powerful to avoid consequences.
LLMs could improve the current legal system by
- Eliminating bias based on race, sex, and appearance
- Eliminating bias based on education, speech, and disability
- Performing evidence analysis independently from testimony
- Using a wider selection of laws and legal precedent than any group of humans has the ability to access or retain.

## Languages
It takes years to master a language. Even when a language is learned, it's quickly forgotten if not spoken regularly.
LLMS can be used to teach languages immersively in a few minutes a day by holding conversations about quotidian topics.
The versatility of LLMs ensures that the learning plan is customized to the student's immediate needs.

## Education
LLMs can be used to extend customized education beyond languages by conversationally teaching all day.
An LLM could be trained to ask probing questions as a student goes about their day, link correct answers to rewards, creating a positive reinforcement loop.
For example, the student could be rewarded for figuring out the tax on a purchase, by receiving an equivalent amount as an allowance.
