# Developing a Problem Statement
A good problem statement is essential for guiding the research process and includes some key elements. It should:
- Clearly define the core issue that the research aims to address.
- Provide context and background.
- Be specific and set the boundaries and scope of the work.
- Be something that can be realistically addressed. 
- Justify the need for the research. 

**Note**: This problem statement moves beyond the scope of a language model to address a crucial gap in the education system.

The gap between teaching and learning causes many children to become marginalized adults.
Critics of our education system complain that students become disinterested because the material is
1. Irrelevant to the student's needs
2. Poorly presented
3. Inappropriate for students with disabilities
4. Prioritizes metrics over learning

What students need is a curriculum that
- Focuses on real-world problems
- Is presented in a realistic way
- Holds their attention
- Is ideally something that they would ordinarily do if there were no educational goal.

For example, the game of basketball is widely taught in physical education classes.
Although most children will not play the game regularly as adults, many play for entertainment.
Some children turn the game into lucrative careers. The rest move on to other pursuits.

Video games are a huge industry that mostly succeeds in wasting a lot of time; however, some of them inadvertently teach real-world skills.
I will use Assassin's Creed as an example of a game that inadvertently teaches history.
By immersing the player in a three-dimensional world, the game inadvertently teaches
- Geography
- Religious trends of the times
- Basic economics
- Social norms
- Fashion

Although the game mechanic of killing people could be replaced by more productive tasks, there are opportunities to expand on any of the above.
For example: basic economics and class.
A game that started the student off as a street urchin during the Industrial Revolution
- Finding menial labor that a small child could manage
- Finding a way to automate or scale that labor
- Improving profitability
- Budgeting to build a business or rise in an existing business
- Climbing the social ladder
- Making an advantageous marriage (not necessarily applicable in today's marriage market, but historically relevant)
