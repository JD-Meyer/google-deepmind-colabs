# Developing a Problem Statement
A good problem statement is essential for guiding the research process and includes some key elements. It should:
- Clearly define the core issue that the research aims to address.
- Provide context and background.
- Be specific and set the boundaries and scope of the work.
- Be something that can be realistically addressed. 
- Justify the need for the research. 

The gap between teaching and learning causes many children to become marginalized adults.
Critics of our education system complain that students become disinterested because the material is
1. Irrelevant to the student's needs
2. Poorly presented
3. Inappropriate for students with disabilities
4. Prioritizes metrics over learning

What students need is a curriculum that
- Focuses on real-world problems
- Is presented in a realistic way
- Holds their attention
- Is ideally something that they would ordinarily do if there were no educational goal.

For example, the game of basketball is widely taught in physical education classes.
Although most children will not play the game regularly as adults, many children play for entertainment.
Some children turn the game into lucrative careers. The rest move on to other pursuits.

Video games are a huge industry that mostly succeeds in wasting a lot of time; however, some of them inadvertently teach real-world skills.
Assassin's Creed is an example of a game that inadvertently teaches history.
By immersing the player in a three-dimensional world, the game inadvertently teaches
- Geography
- Religion
- Economics
- Social norms
- Politics

There are ample opportunities to expand on any of the above by replacing the game mechanic of assassination with other tasks.
Large language models can further tailor any of the above topics to match a student's pace and interests.

* For example: Politics through the lens of fashion.
A recent conversation with M365 Copilot left me amazed at the power implied in 16th-century women's clothing.
*In a world where women were denied power, their bodies became political instruments.*

**Elizabeth I’s gowns communicated:**
- divine right
- virginity
- immortality
- English identity
- Tudor legitimacy
- personal power
  
**Every motif, color, and silhouette was chosen to reinforce her myth.**
- Pearls → purity, chastity, the “Virgin Queen”
- Phoenixes → rebirth, eternal monarchy
- Eyes and ears → omniscience and loyal surveillance
- Tudor roses → dynastic legitimacy
- Serpents → wisdom
- Suns → divine favor

She wore these symbols so consistently that they became part of her political brand.

**Elizabeth used color like a weapon, controlling it with surgical precision.**
- White → purity, divine light, untouchability
- Black → authority, gravity, Spanish‑influenced power
- Gold → majesty, wealth, God’s favor
- Red → royal lineage, martial strength

She often wore white and gold together, creating an almost supernatural glow in candlelit halls. Ambassadors wrote that she appeared “radiant as the sun.”

**Elizabeth's gowns were engineered to reshape her body into an icon.**
The silhouette itself was political:
- High ruffs → elevated status, untouchability
- Broad shoulders → masculine authority
- Rigid bodices → discipline and control
- Farthingales → physical space as power

The farthingale is especially important. It created a literal radius of power around her — no one could physically approach her without permission.
Her body became a fortress.
