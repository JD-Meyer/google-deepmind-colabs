# Ubuntu is a moral system found across Africa

## Western moral values
- Individual rights are prized above collective good
- Assumption of universal adoption (projection of own beliefs)
- Selective application
**Liberty**: Western philosophy values individual freedom, including the right to think, speak, and act without *undue* government or societal interference.
**Universalism**: Assumption of universal ethical values applied equally.
**Individualism**: Personal reliance, independence, and autonomy.
**Private property**: Ownership (of )land, goods, and wealth) is a fundamental right.
**Scientific rationalism**: Values logic (ideally?), evidence-based reasoning (really?), and skepticism towards alternative forms of knowledge such as spiritual or indigenous ways of knowing.
**Judicial process**: Emphasis on rules-based systems and procedures of justice and fairness

## Ubuntu moral values
- Interdependence
- Community
- Relationality
**Personhood through others**: A person becomes a true human being through their relationships with others. *“I am because we are.”*
**Interconnectedness**: Unity of physical, social, and spiritual worlds.
**Moral motivation**: Right actions enhance friendly relationships and end unfriendliness.
**Communal character**: Community is more important than the individual and/or inseparable from the individual.
**Justice as reconciliation**: Justice is a process of healing--focus on restoring relationships, NOT retribution.  

### Reflection
Are you familiar with Ubuntu?
- I have never heard it spelled out this way, but I have seen similar behavioral systems in action.

To what extent have you embraced a particular philosophy or moral tradition in your own life?
- Good question. 
- I'm not familiar with the 

Where do your values come from: family, faith, community, cultural heritage, personal reflection?
- Rejection of family, faith, and community
- Due to personal experience and reflection

How might those values influence what you see as important, acceptable, or harmful in AI innovation?
- What is acceptable should be carefully examined before adoption.
- Assume it's going to do harm and work backward.
