You encountered the concept of **floating point operations (FLOPs)** and learned that estimating the number of FLOPs is an important step to forecast monetary costs, training times, and hardware requirements for large models. You learned a method to estimate the number of FLOPs required to train a model for one epoch and you investigated the relationship between the number of parameters and the number of training tokens.\n",
