For the \"Tokyo\" prompt, the model keeps generating \"Category:\" lists. However, after this, the generations improve dramatically. The model produces increasingly coherent text matching the flashcard format. The final generations in Epoch 4 are high-quality, factually accurate, and stylistically correct. This shows that using bfloat16 does not compromise the quality of the trained model.\n",

This resulted in a model that is able to generate high-quality responses thanks to the powerful 4-billion parameter foundation model that served as the basis for fine-tuning."
