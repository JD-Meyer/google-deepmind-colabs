# Whose voice is missing?

 ‘Where Are We? Evaluating LLM Performance on African Languages’ (Adebara et al 2025) - https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19582 

### Challenges
data scarcity, 
- policy-induced disparities, and 
- suboptimal model performance

### Recommendations
- enact national language policies that mandate the inclusion of Indigenous and underrepresented languages across digital infrastructure, education, and media. 
- Increase the availability of high-quality data for underrepresented African languages across a broad range of downstream tasks.
- Create datasets using native speaker and sourced from real-world interactions


## My Context
Indigenous American voices are largely missing from publicly available datasets
- Most Indigenous American languages are spoken by a small population
- Most Indigenous Americans use English when interacting on the internet
- Few Indigenous American traditions have been collected in published works
- Centuries of erasure by the dominant population have left Indigenous Americans reluctant to expose their culture to outsiders
