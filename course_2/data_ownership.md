# Date Ownership

- Who should steward our data? 
- How do we ensure communities benefit from its use? 
- And what does meaningful access and use look like in the age of AI?


**Interesting insight**: Ownership is obscured by corporate claims that “publicly accessible” equals “free to exploit.”

## Privacy, Ownership, & Consent
List 5 to 10 questions that you would raise with government officials about privacy, ownership, and consent. 
1. Who owns data scraped from the internet, including social media?
2. If it's the data creator, how do you provide transparency and proof of ownership?
3. What happens to the data after sale?
4. Are profits shared with data creators? How?
5. How is anonymity protected?
6. What data security measures will be in place to protect the data owners?
7. Will the data be anonymized to protect creators? In what way? 
8. If not, how will the creators be protected/compensated if the data is used to harm them directly?
9. Do creators get a say in what happens to their data?
10. If data is made publicly available and free for use/exploitation, does the creator remain legally responsible for the contents? 
11. What happens if the data is found to contain incriminating evidence?
12. If data is anonymized, will it be possible to revert the data to its original state?

## Broad Ethical Implications
I'm less interested in data sharing to produce bias against a society, tbqh. 
It's neither a new phenomenon nor surprising.
The issue isn't whether the data will be used to perpetuate bias, but how to limit the damage up front so it can be controlled by the creator.

- Who determines what constitutes a "culturally significant conversation?"
- Who determines how compensation for such a conversation might be determined or distributed?
